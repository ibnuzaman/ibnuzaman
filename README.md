### Hello, I'm [Ibnu Zaman]

I am a software developer with a primary interest in programming languages such as C++, Dart, Golang, and Java. My expertise also extends to utilizing the Flutter framework for mobile application development.

#### Key Skills:
- **Programming Languages:** C++, Dart, Golang, Java
- **Framework:** Flutter
- **Special Interest:** Mobile App Development

In addition, I am currently cultivating an interest in the fields of DevOps and Backend development. I take pleasure in learning and implementing best practices to enhance software development efficiency.

#### Experience and Recent Projects:
- [Konektra]: Konektra is an application that can answer the challenges and problems experienced by "Teman Tuli" and "Teman Bisu", as well as "Teman Dengar" (ordinary people), to communicate with each other without gaps and boundaries. The "Text-to-Speech & Speech-to-Text" feature, will help "Teman Tuli" and "Teman Dengar" who do not understand sign language to communicate with each other. Not only that, Konektra also has a "Sign-to-Text" feature that can translate sign language in real-time through the camera (due to limitations of our server, this feature cannot be used publicly yet)..


#### My Goals:
My goal is to continually evolve in the realm of software development, pursue expertise in DevOps and Backend, and contribute to projects that bring about positive impacts.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibnu-zaman-35911a1b4/). I am always open to meeting fellow developers and engaging in discussions about new ideas.

Thank you for visiting my profile!
